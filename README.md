# Dev-Knot Blog

Dev-Knot Blog Content and Infrastructure deployment with Terraform, AWS and GitHub Actions. Blog content generated by Hugo!

## Deployments - AWS

Builds are published from `develop` and `main` branch upon successful merge. The builds are triggered in AWS Amplify via GitHub Webhooks. The `develop` branch will publish a preview version of the site with a public DNS entry that's subject to change. This can be found inside the AWS Console. Adding a custom domain to the development branch is also possible, but not complete yet. Rules can be created by branch as well. The `main` branch will publish to `www.dev-knot.com` and my old blog domain as well, `www.admin-save.com`.

### Docker Compose

This file contains the `terraform` image that controls deployments of the infrastructure used to host this blog.

## Terraform
